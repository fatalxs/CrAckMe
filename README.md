# Cr@ckMe
## Disclaimer
I created this repository of files during my Polytechnic intern back in 2020 to act as a basic exercise and guide for reverse engineering fundamentals. 
I was not very well versed in reverse engineering but this was based on my basic understanding and thought process. 
I hope this helps and if not feel free to give me feedback to improve!

Thanks :)
